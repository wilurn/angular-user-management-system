# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Management System is a comprehensive full-stack application that provides complete user lifecycle management with advanced features including authentication, role-based access control, analytics, and administrative tools. The system will be built with Angular 17 frontend, NestJS backend with TypeScript and Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL database, and deployed using Docker containers.

5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information including personal details and profile picture, so that I can keep my information current.
